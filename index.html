              This Wiki describes some of the Avengers characters. I have simply

              This is by no means a complete page. For a more complete
              description, please Google your favorite character and read about
              them on Wikipedia. Or better yet, go read the actual comic books
              or see the movies.

            >
            is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published
            by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby,
            the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover
            dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel
            Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who
            often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics'
            most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of
            superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic
            book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953.
            Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America
            has remained in publication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he
            utilizes a nearly indestructible shield that he throws as a
            projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a
            frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an
            experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in
            World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and
            survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern
            times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his
            ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected
            figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time
            leader of the Avengers.

            is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
            writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in the anthology comic
            book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic
            Books. He appears in American comic books published by Marvel
            Comics, as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and
            video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe. In the stories,
            Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his
            Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard
            and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the
            character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial
            issues, and accompanied him with many supporting characters, such as
            J. Jonah Jameson, Harry Osborn, Max Modell, romantic interests Gwen
            Stacy and Mary Jane Watson, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the
            Green Goblin and Venom. His origin story has him acquiring
            spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider;
            these include clinging to surfaces, shooting spider-webs from
            wrist-mounted devices, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense".
          </p>
          <p>
            When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in
            superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick
            to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring
            Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man's
            secret identity and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
            inadequacy, and loneliness" young readers could relate.[9] While
            Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen
            heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor
            like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself
            that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"â€”a
            line included in a text box in the final panel of the first
            Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian,
            the late Uncle Ben.

            >
            is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American
            publisher Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack
            Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The
            Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the
            character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular
            humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his
            alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially
            withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as
            independent personalities and resenting of the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays saving the life of
            Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is
            physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional
            stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive
            rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The
            Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to
            his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk
            has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's
            fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant
            warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and
            Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting
            cast, including Banner's lover Betty Ross, his best friend Rick
            Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, therapist and ally Doc Samson, and his
            co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, etc. However, his
            uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow
            heroes and others. Despite this he tries his best to do what's right
            while battling villains such as Leader, Abomination, Absorbing Man
            and more. Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a
            combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.[3] Although
            the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's
            publication history, the most usual color is green.

            A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious
            scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury
            during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build
            a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit
            of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
            develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he
            designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and
            successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at
            first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly
            reveals himself to be Iron Man.

            (Samuel Thomas Wilson) is a fictional superhero appearing in
            American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
            introduced by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan in
            Captain America #117 (September 1969), and was the first
            African-American superhero in mainstream comic books.[1][2]

          <p>
            As the superhero Falcon, Wilson uses mechanical wings to fly, and
            has limited telepathic and empathic control over birds. Following
            Steve Rogers's retirement, Wilson becomes the newest Captain America
            in All-New Captain America #1 (January 2015) and leader of the
            Avengers. Wilson's deceased nephew was the Incredible Hulk's
            sometime-sidekick Jim Wilson, one of the first openly HIV-positive
            comic-book characters. Jim Wilson's father Gideon Wilson would go on
            to join the Gamma Corps.
